<p>In the era of digital transformation, enterprises in Poland are increasingly adopting advanced IT support automation technologies. One of the breakthrough solutions is <strong>AI Tool Calling</strong> – a mechanism that allows artificial intelligence systems not only to answer questions but also to <strong>perform specific, secure actions in corporate systems in real time</strong>.</p>

<p>Through integration with enterprise-class tools such as Active Directory, Okta, ServiceNow, or Jira, AI stops being just a virtual consultant and becomes an <strong>autonomous agent</strong> capable of instantly resolving tickets – from password resets and account unlocks to access management.</p>

<h3><strong>What is AI Tool Calling?</strong></h3>

<p>AI Tool Calling (also known as <strong>function calling</strong>) is a technology that enables language models – such as <strong>GPT-4</strong> (OpenAI), <strong>Vertex AI</strong> (Google), or <strong>Microsoft Copilot</strong> – to perform actions through defined APIs, scripts, or workflows.</p>

<p>This means that during a conversation with a helpdesk bot, an employee can request a password reset, and the AI will:</p>

<ul>
<li>diagnose the problem,</li>
<li>connect to the identity system (e.g., Active Directory or Okta),</li>
<li>perform the operation according to the company’s security policy,</li>
<li>confirm task completion – all <strong>without human involvement</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Integration with enterprise systems</strong></h3>

<p>In the Polish business landscape, many companies use complex, often custom-built IT systems. <strong>Tool calling</strong> allows them to be securely and efficiently connected with AI, enabling, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatic account unlocks after failed login attempts,</li>
<li>instant MFA reset,</li>
<li>granting and revoking application permissions during employee onboarding and offboarding.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that an employee who loses access to a system regains it within minutes instead of hours, significantly reducing downtime and IT team workload.</p>

<h3><strong>Use cases</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Password reset and account unlock</strong> – AI connects to the authentication system and generates secure one-time reset links.</li>
<li><strong>Automated onboarding</strong> – when a new employee is added to the HR system, AI triggers a sequence of actions: creating accounts in applications, assigning access, configuring email.</li>
<li><strong>Offboarding with GDPR compliance</strong> – immediate revocation of system access and archiving of data in line with company procedures.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Leading platforms on the market</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAI GPT-4</strong> – flexible API, wide plugin ecosystem (e.g., Zapier, ServiceNow), easy integration into diverse IT environments.</li>
<li><strong>Google Vertex AI</strong> – OpenAPI-based integration, support for Google Workspace and cloud services.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft Copilot</strong> – full integration with Microsoft 365 and Azure, automation through Graph API and Power Automate.</li>
</ul>

<p>The choice of platform should depend on the existing IT infrastructure and the company’s automation strategy.</p>

<h3><strong>Security first</strong></h3>

<p>Automating IT operations with AI requires strict security measures:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Principle of least privilege</strong> – AI has access only to resources necessary for the task.</li>
<li><strong>Action validation and input sanitization</strong> – to prevent misuse and errors.</li>
<li><strong>Human-in-the-loop</strong> – human confirmation for high-risk operations.</li>
<li><strong>Full activity logging</strong> – for audits and compliance (GDPR, ISO 27001).</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p><strong>AI Tool Calling</strong> is redefining the role of the helpdesk in Polish enterprises – from a ticket-handling center to a platform for fast, secure, and largely autonomous user support.</p>

<p>With this technology:</p>

<ul>
<li>resolution time for common problems drops from hours to minutes,</li>
<li>operational costs decrease,</li>
<li>IT teams can focus on strategic tasks instead of routine activities.</li>
</ul>

<p>For enterprises aiming to improve efficiency and security of IT support processes, <strong>AI Tool Calling is no longer the future – it is a necessity</strong>.</p>
