<p>Today’s customers expect <strong>consistent communication across all channels</strong> – whether through a website, mobile app, social media, or direct contact. With rising expectations, more companies in sectors such as retail, banking, healthcare, and telecommunications are adopting <strong>omnichannel strategies</strong>, where chatbots and AI assistants play a key role.</p>

<p>Modern conversational bots provide 24/7 availability, high scalability, and consistent customer service across channels. However, despite the growing capabilities of AI, <strong>humans remain the final and crucial line of support</strong> in situations requiring empathy and contextual understanding.</p>

<h3><strong>Omnichannel – a strategic necessity</strong></h3>

<p>Omnichannel integrates all customer touchpoints into a single ecosystem – unlike multichannel, where each channel operates independently.<br /> The benefits are measurable: a 2024 Forrester study showed that banks implementing omnichannel strategies improved customer retention by 15% and reduced operating costs by 10%.</p>

<p><strong>Market examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Bank of America – Erica</strong>: Over 330 million customer inquiries handled by mid-2023, relieving staff and improving financial management.</li>
<li><strong>H&amp;M</strong>: chatbot on Kik app – 86% engagement rate, 4x higher CTR compared to email marketing.</li>
<li><strong>WHO and CDC</strong>: omnichannel chatbots used for mass communication during the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>The role of AI chatbots in omnichannel strategy</strong></h3>

<p>AI-powered chatbots ensure instant, consistent, and scalable communication through:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NLP (Natural Language Processing)</strong> – understanding naturally phrased questions,</li>
<li><strong>CRM and ticketing integrations</strong> – maintaining context across channels,</li>
<li><strong>automatic routing</strong> – directing cases to the right department or agent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gartner forecast: by 2025, over 75% of customer service chatbot projects will be proactive and omnichannel.</p>

<h3><strong>Key benefits of implementing AI chatbots in an omnichannel model</strong></h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>24/7 availability</strong><br /> Chatbots serve customers outside business hours, ensuring quick responses and higher satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability without extra headcount</strong><br /> Ability to handle growing interaction volumes without proportional hiring – according to G2’s 2024 report, global savings will reach $8 billion and 2.5 billion work hours.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency and data insights</strong><br /> Responses are based on a central knowledge base, while interaction data is used to forecast customer needs and personalize service.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Humans as the final line of support</strong></h3>

<p>Research shows that 80% of customers expect the option to escalate to a human agent for complex or sensitive issues.<br /> The best omnichannel strategies ensure <strong>smooth handoff</strong> from chatbot to human, with full context of the prior interaction.<br /> This approach combines the speed and efficiency of automation with the empathy and flexibility of human agents.</p>

<h3><strong>Future trends</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Autonomous AI agents and hyper-personalization</strong> – bots handling full processes (e.g., booking an entire trip) tailored to user preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Voice and multimodal bots</strong> – combining voice, visuals, and text for richer interaction (e.g., visual repair instructions).</li>
<li><strong>Emotionally intelligent AI</strong> – detecting customer mood and adjusting tone accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive support</strong> – anticipating issues and taking proactive actions for customers.</li>
</ul>
