<p>In the world of logistics, where shipment volumes are rising and customers expect fast and flexible service, the pressure on courier companies – in both B2B and B2C models – is greater than ever. Recipients want <strong>real-time information</strong>, the ability to easily reschedule deliveries, and immediate contact in case of issues.</p>

<p>The answer to these needs is <strong>helpdesk automation</strong>, combining AI chatbots, smart notifications, and integration with operational systems. The goal is not to replace people with machines but to create <strong>intelligent, scalable processes</strong> that increase efficiency and enhance the customer experience.</p>

<h3><strong>From “Where Is My Parcel?” to answers in seconds</strong></h3>

<p>The <strong>WISMO</strong> (<em>Where Is My Order</em>) question is one of the most common in customer service for delivery companies. Automated helpdesks eliminate the need to wait on a hotline by connecting directly to tracking systems and providing <strong>up-to-date information</strong> in the customer’s chosen channel – chat, SMS, email, or IVR.</p>

<p>The best systems allow:</p>

<ul>
<li>parcel tracking on a <strong>map with ETA</strong>,</li>
<li>changing delivery preferences,</li>
<li>delivery confirmation via a simple SMS interaction.</li>
</ul>

<p>The result? <strong>Lower service costs, faster responses, and higher customer satisfaction</strong> – without increasing headcount.</p>

<h3><strong>Authority to Leave (ATL) – fewer failed deliveries</strong></h3>

<p>Failed deliveries generate huge costs for the industry. Every reattempt means additional time, fuel, and customer frustration. Automation solves this problem through <strong>proactive ATL notifications</strong> (permission to leave a parcel without signature).</p>

<p>When receiving an SMS or app notification, the customer can indicate a safe delivery spot or give consent online. Companies implementing ATL report:</p>

<ul>
<li>higher success rates on the first delivery attempt,</li>
<li>shorter delivery times,</li>
<li>lower last-mile costs.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Automated rescheduling and exception handling</strong></h3>

<p>Delays, wrong addresses, or absent recipients are unavoidable. Helpdesk automation enables personalized messages with options to:</p>

<ul>
<li>reschedule delivery,</li>
<li>redirect the parcel,</li>
<li>pick up at a collection point.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the B2B segment, the system can also book a new unloading slot at the warehouse or consider special requirements.</p>

<h3><strong>Cost efficiency and ROI</strong></h3>

<p>According to analysis, up to <strong>40% of customer service queries in logistics can be automated</strong>, translating into <strong>20–25% cost reduction in the first year</strong>.</p>

<p>Automation eliminates some redeliveries – each failed attempt can cost a company 60–80 PLN. At scale, the savings are significant.</p>

<h3><strong>Scalability without loss of quality</strong></h3>

<p>While call centers require hiring and training new agents during seasonal peaks, AI systems can handle thousands of queries simultaneously while maintaining the same quality level.</p>

<p>Modern solutions learn from interactions, optimizing responses and predicting customer needs – leading to continuous process improvement.</p>

<h3><strong>The key: integration with operational systems</strong></h3>

<p>For automation to be effective, it must connect with:</p>

<ul>
<li>tracking systems,</li>
<li>CRM,</li>
<li>e-commerce platforms,</li>
<li>route planning and fleet management tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way, a chatbot can not only provide information but also <strong>reschedule a delivery or update an address in the system</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Security and identity verification</strong></h3>

<p>Automated service systems must ensure they are communicating with the right recipient. Methods include:</p>

<ul>
<li>SMS OTP codes,</li>
<li>secure login,</li>
<li>data encryption compliant with GDPR.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, messages must be <strong>clearly branded</strong> to distinguish them from phishing attempts.</p>

<h3><strong>Case study – Deliver In Person</strong></h3>

<p>The Australian company <strong>Deliver In Person</strong> combines real-time tracking, direct contact with the courier, automated notifications, and personalized service, achieving low failed delivery rates and high customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>By integrating the entire process – from bulk order imports to shipment monitoring dashboards – automation becomes part of the strategy, not an add-on.</p>

<h3><strong>Technologies driving delivery automation</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Conversational AI</strong> – handling queries in natural language via chat, voice, and IVR.</li>
<li><strong>Smart notifications</strong> – contextual messages via SMS, email, and apps.</li>
<li><strong>Decision engines</strong> – choosing the fastest resolution path or escalating to a human.</li>
<li><strong>Integration APIs</strong> – connecting helpdesks with logistics systems, CRM, and e-commerce.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics and machine learning</strong> – monitoring service quality, predicting issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>A new standard in delivery</strong></h3>

<p>Helpdesk automation is becoming the foundation of competitive delivery services.<br />Thanks to it, customers <strong>feel informed and in control</strong> – without the need to call or wait for a response.</p>

<p>For companies, it’s not just about cost savings, but above all about <strong>building trust at scale</strong> – and in logistics, where every minute and every customer experience matters, that’s an invaluable advantage.</p>
